# Automed - Test Setup and Verification

## Backend Services Test

### 1. Build and Test Backend Services

```bash
# Test Patient Service
cd backend/patient-service
./gradlew build test

# Test AI Service  
cd ../ai-service
./gradlew build test

# Test API Gateway
cd ../api-gateway
./gradlew build test

# Test Hospital Service
cd ../hospital-service
./gradlew build test

# Test Consultation Service
cd ../consultation-service
./gradlew build test

# Test Sync Service
cd ../sync-service
./gradlew build test
```

### 2. Start Development Environment

```bash
# From project root
make dev-up
```

### 3. Verify Services

- API Gateway: http://localhost:8080
- Eureka Server: http://localhost:8761
- Patient Service: http://localhost:8081/actuator/health
- Hospital Service: http://localhost:8082/actuator/health
- Consultation Service: http://localhost:8083/actuator/health
- Sync Service: http://localhost:8084/actuator/health
- AI Service: http://localhost:8085/actuator/health

## Frontend Test

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd frontend/automed_app
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### 2. Run Tests

```bash
flutter test
flutter analyze
```

### 3. Run Application

```bash
flutter run
```

## Security Verification

### 1. Check for Security Issues

- All endpoints require authentication except health checks
- CORS is properly configured
- Input validation is implemented
- SQL injection protection via JPA
- XSS protection via Spring Security

### 2. Privacy Compliance

- Patient data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- HIPAA/GDPR compliant data handling
- Audit trails for all data access
- Secure storage for sensitive information

### 3. Performance Optimization

- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- Caching for read-heavy operations
- Connection pooling for database connections
- Async processing for heavy operations

## Error Handling

### 1. Backend Error Handling

- Global exception handlers
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages for development
- Generic error messages for production

### 2. Frontend Error Handling

- Network error handling
- Offline mode support
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations

## Testing Coverage

### 1. Unit Tests

- Service layer tests
- Repository tests
- Controller tests
- Utility function tests

### 2. Integration Tests

- API endpoint tests
- Database integration tests
- External service integration tests

### 3. End-to-End Tests

- User workflow tests
- Cross-service communication tests
- Performance tests

## Deployment Readiness

### 1. Docker Configuration

- Multi-stage builds for optimization
- Health checks for containers
- Proper resource limits
- Security scanning

### 2. Kubernetes Deployment

- Resource quotas and limits
- Horizontal pod autoscaling
- Service mesh configuration
- Monitoring and logging

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline

- Automated testing
- Security scanning
- Code quality checks
- Automated deployment

## Monitoring and Observability

### 1. Metrics

- Application metrics via Micrometer
- Business metrics tracking
- Performance metrics
- Error rate monitoring

### 2. Logging

- Structured logging
- Log aggregation
- Log retention policies
- Security event logging

### 3. Tracing

- Distributed tracing
- Request correlation
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Service dependency mapping

## Conclusion

The Automed platform has been thoroughly reviewed and enhanced with:

1. **Complete Backend Architecture**: All microservices implemented with proper separation of concerns
2. **Comprehensive Frontend**: Flutter app with offline support, real-time features, and AI integration
3. **Security & Privacy**: HIPAA/GDPR compliant with end-to-end encryption
4. **Scalability**: Microservices architecture with Kubernetes deployment
5. **Monitoring**: Full observability stack with metrics, logging, and tracing
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage at all levels
7. **DevOps**: Complete CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment
